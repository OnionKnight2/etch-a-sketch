# etch-a-sketch
A browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch

On default, the webpage has 16*16 grid od square divs. User is able to enter size of the grid (Number of squares in one row) via a range input.
After the grid is clicked, user is able to draw on the grid by hovering those squares.
Colors are changing randomly.
User is also able to reset the grid so all the drawing disappears. After the grid is clicked, user can draw again.
